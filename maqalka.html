Generator troubleshooting operation 1

For the last two months we have had a fault with the generator one
 which has been out of order for 40 days,
  and although we have the blue sky grid we 
  have been worried about the generator not working for so long.

22 / April There is a problem with generator
 one which is abnormal voltage <br
On April 24, we started working with PI Dubaiâ€™s engineer, 
who worked with us as a remote control, after a long
 investigation he said the problem was AVR or excitation
  and it was not clear what the problem was solved.
